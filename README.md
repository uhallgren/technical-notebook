# Technical Notebook

This project contains different technical notes. This is a place to share technical scribbles so that
you do not forget e.g. commands. It is designed for myself and other technical persons and is, more or less,
my personal notes about different topics.

I do not put this type of information in Confluence any more as this as been turned into a project manager type
of tool, not a technical notebook.
